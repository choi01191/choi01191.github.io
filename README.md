***1. Hompage***
- Desgner : Using illustrator, I draw mine for presenting  part of my designer perspective.
- Developer: using plain image and it work with photoshop adobe software.
````
For click effect each half of the images, I used radio tag and J query click event. Therefore, if you click one of the pages, it become larger and other paragraph is adding.
````
***2. Skills***
````
I thought a lot for the progress shape, I also considered B plan which is circle progress shape since I heard that percentage of progress bar is not good for resume, it could be too obvious for my weekness. so I just changed into 'ING' ,instead of detail percentage of the bar.
